Hello and welcome to my Code:

*There are two  approaches taken to solve this challenge :

 1-Assuming the iteration is a sequence hence:
-create an empty array to save the result of every multiplication.
-use a for loop to iterate in multiples starting the iteration from 1 and incrementing it by 1 to provide multiples.
-test the three conditions :
 -multiples of A until X.
 -multiples of A+1 until 2X.
 -multiples of A+2 until 3X.
 and store them accordingly 

2-Assuming the iteration is a not in a sequence hence:

Generate multiples of A till X , then multiples of A+1 till 2X then multiples of A+2 till 3X from the start of the iteration

 
 
 Thank you very much.
