Hello and welcome to my Code:

The assumption I have made is:
 -The user will enter positive numbers.
 -The multiplication will include the X,2X and 3X

-A front end was created using HTML AND CSS file to take the entries from the user.
The approach taken to solve this challenge is to :
1-Create an empty array to save the result of every multiplication.
2-Check if A or X are greater then zero if not the user is prompt to enter  an number greater then 0.
2-Use a for loop to iterate in multiples starting the iteration from 2 and incrementing it by 2 to generate multiples.
3-test the three conditions :
 -multiples of A until X.
 -multiples of A+1 until 2X.
 -multiples of A+2 until 3X.
 and store them accordingly .
 -Display the result in the screen.
 - A refresh button is created to clear the content.
 
 Thank you very much.
