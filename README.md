Hello and welcome to my Code:

The assumptions I have made are:
 
 -The user will enter positive numbers.
 
 -The result of multiplications will include the X,2X and 3X.

A front end was created using HTML and CSS files to take the entries from the user.

The approach taken to solve this challenge was to :

1-Create an empty array to save the result of every multiplication.

2-Check if A or X are greater then zero if not the user is prompt to enter  an number greater then 0.

2-Use a for loop to iterate in multiples starting the iteration from 2 and incrementing it by 2 to generate multiples.

3-test the three conditions :

 -multiples of A until X.
 
 -multiples of A+1 until 2X.
 
 -multiples of A+2 until 3X.
 
 and store them accordingly.
 
 -Display the result in the screen.
 
 -A refresh button is created to clear the content.
 
 
 Thank you very much.
