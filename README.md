Hello and welcome to my Code:

The assumptions I have made are:
 
 -The user will enter positive numbers.
 
 -The result of multiplications will include the X,2X and 3X.

A front end was created using HTML and CSS files to take the entries from the user.

The approach taken to solve this challenge was to :

1-Create an empty array to save the result of every multiplication.

2-store the initials and the conditions in two sperate arrays

3-Create a call back function to generate the multiplication  and store it in the resultArray according to the conditions to avoid repetition.

4-call the function to generate the multiples using a ForEach loop

5-store the multiplication in the resultArray

6-Display the result in the screen.
 
 -A refresh button is created to clear the content.
 
 -A sorting buttons is addored to sort the result ascendent descendent.
 
 -A remove duplicate button is also addedd.
 
 
 Thank you very much.
